### Personal Summary

With a background in architecture, art, typology, and history, both at undergraduate and graduate levels, I have honed my skills over 5 years as an algorithm designer and developer. Specializing in geometric algorithms, machine learning, expert systems, and digital fabrication, my self-learning ability and strong curiosity drive my continuous exploration of the intersection between arts, history, philosophy, and technology in the field of architecture.
